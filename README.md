# Dependency Dropdown Using AJAX

This repository contains an implementation of a dependency dropdown feature using AJAX. The functionality allows for the dynamic update of a dropdown list based on the selection of another dropdown list, without the need for page refreshes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Updates**: The secondary dropdown updates in real-time based on the selection from the primary dropdown.
- **AJAX Integration**: Utilizes AJAX to fetch data asynchronously, enhancing the user experience by providing instant feedback.
- **Backend Support**: The implementation includes backend logic to handle data requests and responses, ensuring seamless interaction between the client and server.

## Getting Started
